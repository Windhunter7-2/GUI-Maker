# GUI Maker
This program will allow the user to do things such as click, drag-and-drop, and the likes, to create code for a GUI. Incorporated would also be the ability that functions with the names of the buttons (If there are buttons) will be auto-generated, so that when the button is clicked, it just takes the user to that function.
